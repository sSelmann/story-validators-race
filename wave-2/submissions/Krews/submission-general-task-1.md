# StoryCLI by Krews

This CLI was created by Krews in `Go` to automate the installation and management of Story nodes. It allows you to easily install, configure, and maintain Story nodes, providing a streamlined and efficient setup process with memorable, user-friendly commands.

### Installation

You can easily install the CLI by running the following command:

```bash
sudo -v ; curl https://krews-eu.krews-storage.xyz/install.sh | sudo bash
```

You can check the CLI commands by visiting the [StoryCLI GitHub page](https://github.com/sSelmann/storycli?tab=readme-ov-file).

### Prerequisites

Ensure that Go is installed before running the installation script. The installation script will automatically install Go if it is not already present. To verify your Go installation:

```bash
go version >= 1.20
```
